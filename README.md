# LARAVEL BLOG TEMPLATE

I created this project so I can test some things out and eventually create a blog template.  I will continuously work on this template and add as much notes as possible. I welcome any ideas that you may have.  

## Getting Started

I used Laravel 8 with Sail and Docker on a Windows 10 platform for this project.  Laravel is a neat template that will allow me to get started quickly.  You can use following the documentation at https://laravel.com/docs/8.x.  If you are new to Laravel, I would create one project and repeat the steps until you completed ten projects.  Repeating the Laravel start-up process will guarantee that you retain the information as it may be very confusing at first. 

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the following: 
Laravel 8
WSL2 
Docker Desktop


### Installing

The following is based on a Windows 10 platform
* Download and install Docker Desktop
* Enable WSL2 (The Docket Desktop will enable the WSL1 for you. You might need to upgrade depending on when you read this documentation)
* Download and install your Linux Distro from the Microsoft Store. (This process is in the MS documenation for installing WSL2)
* In Visual Studio, install the WSL remote extension so you can connect to your Linux environment.



## Deployment

Will Add deployment information when I come across it.
